# Feature Scaling using Standardization and Normalization 

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the techniques of feature scaling using standardization and normalization on a dataset. Feature scaling is an essential step in the data preprocessing phase of machine learning, ensuring that different features contribute equally to the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `dataset1.xlsx`.

## Techniques

### Standardization

Standardization involves rescaling the features so that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

### Normalization

Normalization involves rescaling the features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1].

## Implementation

1. **Loading the Dataset:** The dataset is loaded from the `dataset1.xlsx` file.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Basic statistics and visualizations are performed to understand the distribution of the features.

## Dependencies

- Python 
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
